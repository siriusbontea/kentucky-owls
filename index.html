          <h3>Going Beyond Kentucky's Owls:</h3>
          <p>We continue our study of owls with this final project for the <a
              href="https://newmapsplus.github.io/map672/syllabus/">MAP 672: Programming For Web
              Mapping</a>
            course at the
            <a href="https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/">University of Kentucky</a>. Previously, I mapped Snowy Owls to
            meet
            the <a href="https://siriusbontea.github.io/snowy-owls/index.html">final project requirements for
              MAP671</a>, and I discovered that these animals are capable of flying as far as Hawai`i in search of
            food. Eight species of owls can be observed in the great state of Kentucky, with Snowy Owls, though rare
            visitors to the commonwealth, making their appearance from time to time.</p>
          <p>Together with Snowy Owls, Short-Eared and Northern Saw-Whet Owls visit Kentucky from their home ranges.
            Snowy Owls aren't technically migratory, but the other two are winter migrants. The remaining five owl
            species, the Great Horned Owls, Barred Owls Owls, Barn Owls, Eastern Screech Owls, and Long-Eared Owls, are
            all natives to Kentucky.</p>
          <p>Though these birds are not currently endangered, their numbers are declining due to habitat destruction and
            the <a href="https://siriusbontea.github.io/electrical-power/index.html">not-so-green "green energy"
              practices</a> of solar farms, biomass
            powerplants, and wind farms. Environmental pollution also threatens the future of owls. Furthermore, the
            quest for clean air, which is inherently a noble cause, has a dark side. Electric Vehicles use batteries
            that require various rare earth minerals to function. Growing demand for these minerals requires a
            tremendous increase in mining operations that threatens the environment and the interconnected ecosystems
            from pollution and the destruction of habitats. For example, <a
              href="https://therevelator.org/ev-batteries-seabed-mining/">mining the seabed for raw materials</a> has
            the potential to cause devastating effects on the food chain, which can endanger all life, not just our
            feathered friends.</p>
          <p>Studying the splendour of the natural world and advocating for conservation is rewarding. It brings
            much-needed awareness to the inner workings of various policy efforts, which sound good on the surface.
            Advances in electric vehicles wouldn't be where they are today if not the result of strip mining Mother
            Earth for her natural resources. To meet the demand for more batteries, <a
              href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/02/09/lithium-mining-and-the-hidden-environmental-costs-of-evs/">lithium
              mining alone requires moving more tons of earth (resulting in environmental destruction) than mining
              coal</a>. Still, as we dig deeper (no pun intended), we learn that the green movement isn't as green as
            the intertwined corporate and government sponsors will have us believe. When <a
              href="https://www.americaspower.org/its-time-to-end-subsidies-for-renewable-energy/">hundreds of billions
              of dollars are tied up in government subsidies</a>, you can rest assured that truth in advertising is one
            of the first casualties.</p>
          <p>Owls are but a small part of the natural world, and Kentucky is a small corner of our natural world. This
            simple mapping project highlights that both elements are interconnected with other ecosystems and physical
            geographies. We need to better safeguard the environment for ourselves and future generations by holding the
            cabal of government, corporate, and media interests accountable every time they lie to us about protecting
            our environment. We only have one chance to get it right, and we should feel compelled to take action.</p>

      An artist, scientist, bibliophile, and autodidact at heart, Sirius enjoys applying these
      facets in his role of dad and husband first and foremost. He also finds happiness with
      spending time with <a>Shin'yū the Maltipoo<span><img src="site-data/graphics/shin-yu.jpg"

      (Shin'yū or 親友 is the Japanese term for "best friend"). Sirius also enjoys calligraphy,
      metacognition, philosophy, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge regardless of the path it
      puts him on. He generally prefers Open Source Software solutions such as FreeBSD for daily
      computing, QGIS for cartography and geospatial analysis, GIMP and Inkscape for image
      manipulation. However, he is no stranger to proprietary solutions such as ArcGIS Pro, Adobe
      Photoshop and Illustrator.
